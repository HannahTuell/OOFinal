We will be creating a side-scrolling, platformer game. The Anti-Hero of the game is the Evil Witch Ann who can control the elements. Her goal is to capture the Good Wizard, Earl, who is always just out of reach. Ann and Earl are classmates at Wizarding Academy No. 5. Earl became interested in Ann, flirting with her and building tension until he finally asked her out. Ann happily agreed to go on a date with him, but then Earl stood her up for another witch. In a fit of fury, Ann vowed vengeance so no other witches would have to suffer heartbreak at the hands of Earl again.
